# DOCREDACTOR__HashCode
We are creating a Web Application(DOCREDACTOR) which takes the input from the user as a document in different formats like image or text
format. If the document is in image form it is first converted into text format after which our application redact important data using
Machine Learning algorithm(Watson natural language) from the document uploaded by the user and converted into a scrambled form so that it
is not understandable at the server side.  After this two files are generated:-  (i)Redacted document . (ii)Redacted information . which 
are stored in user account. 


First of all we create database on phpMyAdmin using SQL Query and PHP language.
We use the wamppServer to provide localhost in which we create database named as redact and table name as user.
After creating the database we connnect with our web application.
